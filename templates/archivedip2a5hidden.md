## Abstract

This amendment adds a weekly allocation of points that goes to integrations providers (e.g., Tesla) so that they earn a share of the weekly baseline rewards pool. The initial value is 500 points per active integration.

If Digital Infrastructure Inc. maintains the integration on behalf of a third party, they shall hold the tokens in escrow for that third party and may only deduct tokens as needed to cover the cost charged directly by the third party and/or the SIM provider.&#x20;

For example, imagine Digital Infrastructure maintains a Kia integration and receives $4 USD worth of tokens per vehicle per month. If Kia charges Digital Infrastructure Inc. $5 per month, Digital Infrastructure Inc. keeps all of the $DIMO. If Kia charges $1 per month, they keep $1 worth and hold the other $3 worth of $DIMO for Kia to claim at any point.

## Motivation

Integrations providers typically bear a cellular, cloud, and/or licensing fee to connect vehicles to DIMO each month and without this rewards mechanism, subscription fees to connect to DIMO would soon be added.  By allowing integrations providers to earn a modest amount of $DIMO with baseline each week, we can avoid instituting mandatory subscriptions while further aligning all parties by allowing them a natural pathway to accumulate $DIMO tokens.

**Long-term automakers should host these integrations themselves and become major stakeholders of the DIMO ecosystem and holders of $DIMO.**

At current issuance levels, this would come out to somewhere around 2 $DIMO per week per car and would therefore dilute user earnings by about 8.5% per month. It's almost as if the network grew by 8.5% overnight.

## Specification

<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would incorporate the following changes to the Abstract section of DIP-2:</mark>

This proposal specifies the conditions by which DIMO users <mark style="color:red;">and integrations providers</mark> will earn baseline $DIMO token rewards for connecting to the network.

Baseline Issuance rewards users <mark style="color:red;">and integrations providers</mark> with a piece of a weekly issuance pool of $DIMO tokens.

<mark style="color:green;">// and in the Specifications section:</mark>

Qualified users <mark style="color:red;">and entities</mark> will earn their share of this weekly issuance based on how many points they've earned relative to other users <mark style="color:red;">and entities</mark> in that period. In other words, if you earn 1% of the points in a given week, you also get 1% of the tokens distributed that week.

...

<mark style="color:red;">Additionally, integrations providers earn 500 points, and therefore $DIMO, for the vehicle connections that they enable alongside their users. Each integration has the same qualification requirements for earning each week as it does for a user; vehicles they provide the connection for must be paired, verified, and sending data.</mark>

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-2 would be updated and these changes implemented once the software code is audited and ready, or after the four day timelock, whichever is later.  This would be expected to launch by the end of 2024.
