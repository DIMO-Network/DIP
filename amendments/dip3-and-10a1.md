## NOTES: DELETE BEFORE PUBLISHING

Mint DCX using USDC and reward nodes in USDC

$1.25 gets you 50k requests within 30 days (not a calendar month... 30 days...)

DCX = $0.000025. $1.25 gets you 500,000 DCX.

One DCX gets you one query response line. e.g., lat, long, fuel ever 15s for from 12:00 - 12:01pm = 3 signals \* 4 intervals = 12 DCX

Because costs don't scale linearly, and rather increase, there should be a multiplier on DCX cost based on responses in a single query. E.g., (1 + count of items/1000) DCX per item

Webhooks = 100 DCX per event
