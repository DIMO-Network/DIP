## Abstract

This amendment adds an official $DIMO token on the Solana blockchain.

It also tweaks the DIMO Credit minting flow to incorporate USDC support.

## Motivation

Solana has emerged as a meaningful blockchain that many DIMO users already know and love to use. By allowing $DIMO to seamlessly bridge to Solana, users are able to utilize their tokens with the Solana wallets and apps they already love using.

Additionally, we can streamline DIMO Credit purchases by allowing them to be created with USDC, prior to converting USDC to $DIMO and burning it. This makes the developer experience more efficient and simple, while preserving the automated $DIMO token burn.

## Specification

_<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would edit the following section within the DIP-10 Specification section:</mark>_&#x20;

### The DIMO token ($DIMO)

_The primary token of the DIMO ecosystem used for governance, staking, and payments_&#x20;

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-10 would be updated after the four day timelock. The Solana version of $DIMO will be recognized immediately once deployed. The adjustment to the DIMO Credit purchase flow will be deployed once the relevant contract updates are completed and audited. All disclaimers on every DIP and amendment will be updated to include the Solana token.
