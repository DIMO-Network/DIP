## Abstract

This proposal shortens the overall baseline schedule and simplifies the points and levels system.

## Motivation

This proposal is motivated by the need to align DIMO‚Äôs incentives with its next stage of growth. As the network matures and real utility emerges, the original long-term emission schedule and generous rewards are no longer necessary to bootstrap adoption. Reducing future emissions ensures the long-term health of the token economy. Simplifying the points and levels system also makes it easier for users to understand their contributions and earnings, setting a stronger foundation for sustainable, utility-driven growth.

## Specification

<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would incorporate the following changes to the Abstract section of DIP-2:</mark>

Baseline Issuance rewards users with a piece of a weekly issuance pool of $DIMO tokens. Users earn varying amounts based on how they're connected and how long they've been connected, even if there is no end customer using their data. The amount that is distributed each week will start at 1,105,000 $DIMO and will decrease 15% ~~<mark style="color:red;">each year</mark>~~ <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">every 52 weeks until, week 364, just prior to the year 2030, when issuance is scheduled to conclude.</mark>

~~<mark style="color:red;">This stands in contrast to Marketplace Issuance, which rewards users based on fees generated by the network based on demand for user data.</mark>~~

<mark style="color:red;">301,600,530</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">450,000,000</mark>~~ $DIMO tokens (<mark style="color:red;">30%</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">45%</mark>~~ of total supply) are allocated to driver rewards. Deducting the airdrop, this leaves <mark style="color:red;">260,264,270</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">382,491,185</mark>~~ $DIMO (<mark style="color:red;">26%</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">38%</mark>~~ of the total supply) to be issued over <mark style="color:red;">7</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">40</mark>~~ years for Baseline Issuance.

_<mark style="color:green;">// And would make the following changes to the motivation</mark>_ <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">section of DIP-2:</mark>

The goal of Baseline Issuance is to prime the network by incentivizing drivers to connect vehicles and stream data prior to the growth of demand from data consumers and app developers. As DIMO matures, <mark style="color:red;">users will earn from and enjoy practical use cases</mark>[~~<mark style="color:red;">Market Issuance</mark>~~](../dip-3-marketplace-issuance.md) ~~<mark style="color:red;">will gradually supplement and replace Baseline Issuance</mark>~~, thus removing the need to inflate the supply of $DIMO in perpetuity.

_<mark style="color:green;">// And would make the following changes to the s</mark>_<mark style="color:green;">pecifications section of DIP-2:</mark>

In year one, DIMO will issue 1,105,000 $DIMO per week to all qualified DIMO users at 5 AM UTC each Monday. This issuance amount will automatically decrease by 15% every 52 weeks following the anniversary of the December 12, 2022 mainnet launch, with Baseline Issuance ending in <mark style="color:red;">week 364 (nearly the beginning of the year 2030)</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">40 years</mark>~~, unless modified by a future DIP.

...

Qualified users will earn their share of this weekly issuance based on how many <mark style="color:red;">levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">points</mark>~~ they've earned relative to other users in that period. In other words, if you earn 1% of the points in a given week, you also get 1% of the tokens distributed that week.

...

<mark style="color:red;">Levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">Points</mark>~~ are calculated as follows:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-26 at 11.23.05‚ÄØPM.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

...

Every box depicting <mark style="color:red;">levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">points</mark>~~ can stack on one another. This means that a car can have a streak level, a boost level, a software connection, and hardware connection for a maximum <mark style="color:red;">12 levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">16,000 weekly points</mark>~~. A car must send valid data to qualify for rewards in a given week. If a car isn't driven, it will receive zero $DIMO regardless of any streak or boost.

In the example shown in the table above, Alice earns 2 <mark style="color:red;">levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">,000 points</mark>~~ for having been connected <mark style="color:red;">over 36</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">between 21 to 35</mark>~~ weeks, <mark style="color:red;">2 levels for locking 1,500 $DIMO for a year</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">1,000 points for locking 500 $DIMO for 6 months</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">, 1 level</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">1,000 points</mark>~~ for her Limited software connection, and <mark style="color:red;">6 levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">6,000 points</mark>~~ for having comprehensive device installed in her vehicle.

Here there are 40,000 cars connected to DIMO and each car <mark style="color:red;">has an average of 6 levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">generates an average of 6,000 points</mark>~~ that week, for a total of 240,000~~<mark style="color:red;">,000 points</mark>~~ <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">levels</mark>. Alice's <mark style="color:red;">9 levels</mark>~~<mark style="color:red;">10,000 points</mark>~~ represent 0.004% of the points for that week (10,000 √∑ 240,000,000). Therefore, she earns 46.04 out of the 1,105,000 tokens from this pool (1,105,000 \* 0.004%).

...

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-2 would be updated and these changes implemented after the four day timelock, whichever is later. Note that the decrease in weekly rewards would not go change until Decemberdf.
