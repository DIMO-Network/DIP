## Abstract

This proposal removes the requirement to use Snapshot as the venue for voting.

## Motivation

Snapshot is charging $600 per month to vote on Polygon. This is expensive!

## Specification

If passed this proposal, will remove mention of Snapshot from DIP-1 and will allow the DIMO Foundation to choose the venue for voting, assuming it fulfills the purpose and requirements of the voting procedures.

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-1 will be updated as specified above after the four day timelock concludes.
