## Abstract

This amendment expands the DIMO Foundation‚Äôs authority to sell $DIMO tokens from the treasury to fund operations and invest in strategic business lines swiftly, ensuring actions prioritize the benefit of the DIMO protocol and token.

## Motivation

The DIMO ecosystem is at a pivotal moment. Being able to act fast and stay nimble matters more than ever to fund operations and seize emerging opportunities. Over reliance on governance introduces delays and coordination overhead that undermine those efforts, especially at time where voting participation is typically low. Granting this enhanced authority enables agile, mission-focused action, while preserving transparency and guardrails to ensure accountability and alignment with the token‚Äôs long-term interests.

## Specification

_<mark style="color:green;">// If passed, this proposal would</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**replace the entirety of the**</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:green;">**Financial Plan & Ask**</mark>_](https://docs.dimo.org/governance/improvement-proposals/dip6#financial-plan-and-ask) _<mark style="color:green;">within the DIP-6 Specification.</mark>_

**(a) Resources.** The Foundation may sell $DIMO from treasury without per-sale governance approval to fund operations, liquidity, strategic partnerships, and investments that materially advance the protocol. Sales may be conducted via programmatic execution, RFQ/OTC transactions, auctions, or strategic placements.

**(b) Use of Funds.** Net proceeds may be applied to: (i) protocol R\&D and operations; (ii) ecosystem and distribution partnerships; (iii) incubation, acquisition, or investment in DIMO-aligned products and businesses (including equity, token warrants, SAFEs, and convertibles); (iv) regulatory, security, and risk management functions; and (v) liquidity and market quality programs.

1. The Foundation may invest in or acquire teams and assets that accelerate adoption. Any acquired IP must comply with Section (d). Strategic sales should include use-commitments or lockups where appropriate.
2. The Foundation may provide or loan $DIMO to approved market makers, operate or seed on-chain liquidity, and enter inventory-neutral arrangements to improve spread, depth, and availability.
3. The Foundation may hold and rebalance reserves across fiat, stablecoins, short-duration instruments, and qualified yield vehicles (e.g., registered funds and cash-management vehicles) to extend runway and manage risk, up to 100% of non-$DIMO reserves, subject to compliance and custody controls.
4. All expenditures, contracts, and treasury actions must primarily benefit the DIMO protocol and $DIMO token.

**(c) Operating Envelope.** The Foundation may adopt and revise an internal annual operating plan (OPEX + program spend) without fixed category caps.

**(d) IP & Work Product.** All IP funded by the Foundation must be (i) owned by the Foundation, (ii) perpetually and royalty-free licensed to it, or (iii) open-sourced under a permissive license, with the Foundation retaining perpetual usage rights.

_<mark style="color:green;">// and insert the following adjustment into the</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:green;">Authority & Domain</mark>_](https://docs.dimo.org/governance/improvement-proposals/dip6#authority-and-domain) _<mark style="color:green;">section.</mark>_

#### Canonical Tokens

The DIMO Foundation may unilaterally update DIP-10 to reflect changes to canonical token definitions, including but not limited to the addition or removal of supported blockchains, contract addresses, and token identifiers. Such updates must be made in good faith, solely for the benefit of the DIMO protocol and $DIMO token, and published promptly in the official governance documentation.

## Implementation

If passed, DIP-6 would be updated as specified above after the four day timelock concludes.
