## Abstract

Marketplace Issuance refers to rewarding drivers based on what third parties are paying for their data.&#x20;

Marketplace Issuance will start off very simple, but will likely evolve with future DIPs as the ecosystem matures and regulatory clarity improves.

The DIMO Foundation will collect proceeds from the sale of aggregate and anonymized data and for each dollar (USD) received will burn 0.01 $DIMO and distribute the remaining 0.99 to the set of users who have opted in to data sales as a part of the vehicle pairing process.

Users may earn additional $DIMO when they use marketplace apps. The amount and terms will vary as specified by the app developer and agreed to by users so long as the reward is remitted in $DIMO and 1% is burned. The Foundation can accept cash and remit $DIMO on the apps behalf if the app developer prefers not to interact with $DIMO directly.

## Motivation

DIMO users should be rewarded primarily based on the value that they generate on the DIMO network.&#x20;

In the early stages of DIMO's development, the vast majority of rewards will come from [Baseline Issuance](dip-2-baseline-issuance.md). As the network matures, this balance will likely shift the other way. This is comparable to other web3 networks like Helium, where their rewards from proof of coverage hopefully shrink in comparison to rewards from data transfer over time.

## Specification

The highly detailed description of the DIP including precise terms, protocol updates, blockchain transactions and smart contract code that will be executed with comments, and more.

## Implementation

A description of the implementation procedure that would follow if the DIP achieves a successful vote.
