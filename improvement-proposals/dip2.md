## Abstract

This proposal specifies the conditions by which DIMO users will earn baseline $DIMO token rewards for connecting to the network.

Baseline Issuance rewards users with a piece of a weekly issuance pool of $DIMO tokens. Users earn varying amounts based on how they're connected and how long they've been connected, even if there is no end customer using their data. The amount that is distributed each week will start at 1,105,000 $DIMO and will decrease 15% each year.

This stands in contrast to Marketplace Issuance, which rewards users based on fees generated by the network based on demand for user data.

450,000,000 $DIMO tokens (45% of total supply) are allocated to driver rewards. Deducting the airdrop, this leaves 382,491,185 $DIMO (38% of the total supply) to be issued over 40 years for Baseline Issuance.

## Motivation

The goal of Baseline Issuance is to prime the network by incentivizing drivers to connect vehicles and stream data prior to the growth of demand from data consumers and app developers. As DIMO matures, [Market Issuance](../dip-3-marketplace-issuance.md) will gradually supplement and replace Baseline Issuance, thus removing the need to inflate the supply of $DIMO in perpetuity.

It is also designed to: reward and give control to those who show long-term support for DIMO; incentivize a continuous data connection, which tells a fuller story of driver behavior and vehicle performance when maintained over a long-period of time; reward those who provide a greater quantity and frequency of reliable data; and avoid rewarding based on distance or time traveled as not to incentivize unnecessary and wasteful driving.

## Specification

Per this DIP, the weekly issuance will be allocated per the following methodology. $DIMO token holders can vote to alter these rewards formulas, alter the issuance amounts, and make other changes in subsequent DIPs.

In year one, DIMO will issue 1,105,000 $DIMO per week to all qualified DIMO users at 5 AM UTC each Monday. This issuance amount will automatically decrease by 15% every 52 weeks following the anniversary of the December 12, 2022 mainnet launch, with Baseline Issuance ending in 40 years, unless modified by a future DIP.

A weekly issuance was chosen because driving behavior varies dramatically by time of day (i.e., it‚Äôs concentrated during peak commuting hours). If the issuance protocol were to distribute $DIMO by the hour, then drivers would be under-compensated during rush hour (as the reward would be split between a high percentage of drivers) and overcompensated for driving at 3AM US Eastern Time. A weekly issuance allows for a predictable issuance schedule, transaction fee optimization, and relatively frequent rewards distributions without incentivizing abnormal driving behavior.

Qualified users will earn their share of this weekly issuance based on how many points they've earned relative to other users in that period. In other words, if you earn 1% of the points in a given week, you also get 1% of the tokens distributed that week.

To be qualified for rewards, users must: download an authorized DIMO client; add their vehicle and establish an integration; complete vehicle minting and device pairing on-chain as applicable; and transmit data each week. As of the time of this writing, [DIMO Mobile](http://onelink.to/dimo) is the only authorized client.

Users must also opt-in to allowing their aggregated and anonymized data to be used to improve the network for troubleshooting purposes, and to create data products. This work will be done by Digital Infrastructure Inc. on behalf of the DIMO Foundation. Aggregated and anonymized means that consumers of user data will not be able to determine personal information about an individual user. An example of such a report would be "the average range of Tesla Model Y's in California" and even this report could only be compiled if there were a statistically significant number of Tesla Model Y's connected in California. Proceeds from the sale of user data will increase Market Issuance and will fund future the DIMO Foundation. This may also be amended by a future DIP.

Lastly, user wallets must not be flagged by Chainalysis' [AML tools](https://www.chainalysis.com/free-cryptocurrency-sanctions-screening-tools/) as risky or fraudulent.

Points are calculated as follows:

Note that:

**Streak Levels**: are tied to the vehicle, which means that swapping out an OBD device or transferring a vehicle to another user will preserve the level for that car; a streak cannot be transferred from one car to another; and vehicles that fail to connect for three consecutive weeks will fall back one streak level.

**Lock Levels**: are per vehicle (e.g., it would take 8,000 $DIMO to boost two separate vehicles to level 4); may be assigned and unassigned to any car in your account; and can be upgraded at any time, but cannot be downgraded prematurely (e.g., you can roll 500 $DIMO from a level 1 contract that is still locked, add 1,000 more $DIMO, and upgrade it to a new level 2 contract that restarts the lock period).

**Connection types**: Currently licensed connections are categorized as follows:

Level 6: R1 by Ruptela, AutoPi x DIMO by AutoPi, Tesla in collaboration with Digital Infrastructure Inc., Enhanced Wireless by Smartcar in collaboration with Digital Infrastructure Inc.

Level 3: Macaron by Hashdog

Every box depicting points can stack on one another. This means that a car can have a streak level, a boost level, on top of their data connection for a maximum level of 12. A car must send valid data to qualify for rewards in a given week. If a car isn't driven, it will receive zero $DIMO regardless of any streak or boost.

In the example shown in the table above, Alice earns 1 level for having been connected between 21 to 35 weeks, 2 levels for locking 1500 $DIMO for 12 months, and 6 levels for having premium connection for her vehicle.

Here there are 40,000 cars connected to DIMO and each car generates an average of 6 levels that week, for a total of 240,000 levels. Alice's 9 levels represent 0.00375% of the levels for that week (9 √∑ 240,000). Therefore, she earns 41.4375 out of the 1,105,000 tokens from this pool (1,105,000 \* 0.00375%).

Curious how this would play out for people besides Alice? The table below shows earnings for a small sample of hypothetical drivers in the same hypothetical week. This is meant to be illustrative using a small handful of made up users, not an exhaustive list of every combination of attributes.

## Implementation

In order to enact the specification above, the DIMO Foundation has engaged Digital Infrastructure Inc., the publisher of [DIMO Mobile](https://onelink.to/dimo), to confirm eligibility, calculate points, and trigger the rewards smart contract to distribute tokens.
