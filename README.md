# DIMO Governance Hub

DIMO token holders vote on proposals that determine how DIMO works. They're known as DIMO Improvement Proposals ("DIPs" for short) and can upgrade the way the DIMO smart contracts and tokens work, can grant privileges (e.g., a vote to issue a license to make DIMO Miners to a hardware manufacturer), set tokens aside for grants, and more. More on why this matters [here](https://docs.dimo.zone/overview/dimotoken/user-ownership).

### **Participation Instructions**

There are steps you must take in order to vote. To have your tokens counted you must "delegate" your voting power to someone. **Even if you want to vote with your own tokens, you still must register by delegating them to yourself.**

**When you delegate, your tokens stay securely in your wallet.** You always retain full control and can still transfer them. You can change who you've delegated to at any time. Once you delegate, the person you delegate to will be able to vote with your tokens in all future votes until you redelegate to someone else.

We recommend using [this website](https://delegate.dimo.zone/) to easily delegate to yourself or others. On this page click "Connect Wallet" and sign in with a wallet that contains $DIMO. We recommend using a mobile wallet (Metamask desktop is not supported). Then:

* _To be able to vote on a proposal yourself using the wallet you just connected_, click "Register to vote" and execute the transaction in your wallet
* _To delegate your voting power to someone we recommend_, click the "Delegate" button under that person name on their card, click "Confirm", then execute the transaction in your wallet
* _To delegate your voting power to anyone else_, enter their wallet address in the large input field at the top, click the "Delegate" button right next to it, then execute the transaction in your wallet

### DIMO Improvement Proposals

Below, you can see active proposals that $DIMO token holders can vote on now, proposals that are receiving feedback and aren't ready for voting yet, and the entire index of all DIPs passed and failed. You may view DIPs on [Github](https://github.com/DIMO-Network/DIP) or [Gitbook](https://docs.dimo.zone/dips). The official discussion forum for DIMO governance is the [Discord](https://chat.dimo.zone).
